This project demonstrates how to deploy a three-tier application architecture in AWS, where the database and backend are hosted in private subnets, while the frontend is placed in a public subnet. First, I set up a MySQL database on an EC2 instance within a private subnet. To secure the database, I configured it to only allow remote connections from trusted IP addresses. I updated MySQLâ€™s configuration to allow connections from other instances and created a new user with the necessary privileges to manage the database.

Next, I set up the backend using Django on a separate EC2 instance within another private subnet. After configuring the security group to allow necessary connections, I cloned the Django application from GitHub, installed the required dependencies inside a virtual environment, and configured the database connection using environment variables. I also granted the required database privileges and ran Django migrations to set up the application.

For the frontend, I deployed an Nginx server on an EC2 instance in the public subnet. After configuring Nginx to serve static files and forward requests to the Django backend, I ensured that it was running properly by unlinking the default Apache page and testing the new configuration .

Lastly, to make the backend Django application run continuously even after a reboot, I created a systemd service. This service ensures that the application starts automatically and sets the necessary environment variables for database access. I enabled the service, tested it, and monitored the logs to ensure everything was running smoothly. This setup follows best practices by isolating the database in a private subnet, while allowing public access to the frontend, creating a secure and scalable application architecture.
